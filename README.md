[Demo](http://ignovak.github.com/presentation)
[Nojs Demo](http://ignovak.github.com/presentation/nojs.html)

Note: nojs page uses navigating by tabindexes.
TODO: navigating using location hash and :target pseudoclass.

This page has been built with [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com).
For launching it locally use

    $ gem install middleman
    $ git clone https://github.com/ignovak/presentation.git
    $ cd presentation
    $ middleman

That will launch the app on localhost:4567.

If you just want a build, you can find it in this [branch](http://github.com/ignovak/presentation/tree/gh-pages/).
